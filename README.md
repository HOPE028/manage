# Manage

---

*Ongoing project...*


## What 

Manage is a **Web App** created for teams tracking the **hours** members are working/volunteering/practicing. Aside from offering hour tracking abilities, it offers comprehensive **social media** capabilities such as **messaging** other team members, seeing other **members information**, and having comprehensive ways of seeing how your hours have been **changing**.

## How It Works

A *Manager* creates a new `Team` where they choose what information any `Member` joining must sumbit. Upon choosing all the `team` settings, they will receive a **team code**. They can share that team code with whatever other potential members they would like to. The member would then use the team code to create an account and join the team. Upon joining the team, they will have access to whatever information the Manager has given them access to about other team members, the amount of hours they have been working, ... To be continued.
