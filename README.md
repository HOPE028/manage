# Manage

---

*Ongoing project...*


## What 

Manage is a **web app** created for teams tracking the **hours** members are working/volunteering/practicing. Aside from offering hour tracking abilities, it offers comprehensive **social media** capabilities such as **messaging** other team members, seeing other **members information**, and having comprehensive ways of seeing how your hours have been **changing**.

## How It Works

A *Manager* starts by signing up. Once signed up, they will enter a page where they will enter what type of information they would like *Members* to submit when signing up. Once they have submitted what information the Member must give, they will then control what *General Users* and fellow *Members* will be able to see and what they will have access to.
